# Signed Distance Fields – Beamer Presentation

A professionally designed **Beamer** slide deck introducing and explaining  
**Signed Distance Fields (SDFs)**, from fundamentals to advanced applications  
in computer graphics.

---

## Overview

This presentation covers:

- **Concept & definition** of Signed Distance Fields  
- **Mathematical foundation** and formal expressions  
- **Applications** in rendering, physics, and modeling  
- **Raymarching** with step-by-step animations  
- **Font rendering** using SDFs  
- **Collision detection** with penetration depth  
- **Shape blending** and procedural modeling techniques

The slides include **custom animations**, a **consistent color theme**,  
and **TikZ-based diagrams** for clear, visual explanations.
